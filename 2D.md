**Ask the right questions:**

What drew you to 2D art in the first place?

Why do you want to draw?

What art style do you want to learn?

Do you want to learn drawing in order to become a professional 2D artist or this is just a hobby?

**Learn basics**

Before you start to draw complex forms and shapes, complex drawings, you should be able to draw basic 2D shapes that will help you build the scenes in the upcoming compositions. You should be able to draw shapes like circles, rectangles, triangles, elipses, curves etc. Also, the lines you draw should be straight and the curves need to be smooth. In order to achiecve that, you should draw with the whole arm, using your elbow and your shoulder joints because you won&#39;t be able to do that using just your wrist. Draw slowly because lines need to be repeatable and controlled and don&#39;t trace same line over and over again.

**Learn to draw shapes**

Shapes are about composition, which is fundamental, about 2D iconographic shapes, dynamism of the shapes, the reading and the silhouettes of the shapes.

**Learn to draw forms**

Form is related to everything that gives us a perception of 3 dimensionality.

Perspective in real life is a complicated affair. Most people can roughly sketch things so they look about right, but being very precise is tricky because objects are at all kinds of angles.

Drawing in perspective is a way to interpret 3D objects on 2D surfaces. In basic one-point perspective drawing , lines are either vertical, horizontal or receding toward the vanishing point . In two-point, lines are either horizontal or receding toward one of the two vanishing points. In three-point perspective, all lines recede toward one of the three vanishing points.

Learn to add volume to the 2D drawing in order to make it look more real. One way to do that is to use lights and shadows that will create different values across the volume.

Symmetry and assymetry are used to describe the objects. For example, almost all organic objects are asymetric, but the hard surface objects (buildings, cars, ships etc) can be symmetric and asymmetric, depending on the construction.

**Learn color theory**

Color theory is both the science and art of using color. It explains how humans perceive color; and the visual effects of how colors mix, match or contrast with each other. Color theory also involves the messages colors communicate and the methods used to replicate color.

**Learn human anatomy**

The study of human anatomy represents much more than the naming of parts and understanding of their functions, it requires knowledge about forms, proportions, dynamism, facial expresions, gestures and much more.

**Learn to add details**

The details are the last thing you should add to your drawing. Shapes and forms, which represent 80% of your drawing should take 20% of time and details, which represent 20% of your artwork can take up to 80% of the time. Details refers to textures, literal smaller details of objects as well as the color of things in your composition.

**Tips:**

Find top artists in the industry and learn from them, watch interviews, lectures, tutorials, study their professional practices, routines, work ethics and the tools they are using and how they use them in their workflow.

Learn about the masters in the domain, study their work because, even if their work is hundreds of years old, you can still learn from them. Learn about different styles and try to find the one that suits you or find your own.

Also, find the artworks of other people just starting out and understand that the journey you are about to take is a long and challenging one, but it&#39;s possible if you put enough work and dedication in it.
