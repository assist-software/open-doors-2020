- Reading list
  - **C++ fundamental concepts to cover:**
    - Fundamental data types (int/uint, long/ulong, float, double, char, bool, etc.)
    - Arrays (one and 2-dimensional)
    - Constants (_const_)
    - Enums
    - Pointers and References (differences and alikes)
    - Functions (passing arguments by value/pointer/reference, local variables, function overloading)
    - Classes
      - Types of class members (data, constructors/destructors, methods)
      - Access specifiers (public/private/const)
      - Constant data members ( **const** )
      - Types of constructors (implicit vs. explicit constructors)
      - Class instantiation (operators **new** and **delete** )
      - Static vs. non-static members
      - Inheritance
      - Method overloading
      - **Virtual** and **pure virtual** functions
      - Operator overloading (at least &#39;=&#39;, &#39;==&#39; and &#39;[]&#39;)
      - Shallow vs. deep copy
      - Iterators
      - Templates
      - Streams (std::cin/ std::cout, std::ifstream/ std::ofstream, std::stringstream)
    - Namespaces
    - **typedef** operator
    - Strings
      - char[], char\*, std::string
      - conversions from std::string to number and back (see **std::to\_string()** function from C++ 11, **std::stoi** , **std::stol** , etc.)
      - string splitting (tokenization) based on some separators
      - conversion of data from std::string to char\* and back (see the **std::string::c\_str()** function)
    - Core Data Structures (vector, list, stack, queue, ordered/unordered map and ordered/unordered set)
      - Learn to implement them from scratch (at least the basic ones)
      - Use some data structures from std library ( **std::list** , **std::stack** , **std::queue** , **std::map** / **std::unordered\_map** , **std::set/std::unordered\_set** )
    - Operations with files
      - Checking if a file exists on the disk
      - Creation of a new file
      - Opening an existing file for writing/reading/appending
      - Reading a file line by line

- **Some very good books on C++ best practices (for curious readers):**
  - **Effective C++ (Scott Meyers)** –This was written with the aim of being the best second book C++ programmers should read, and it succeeded. Earlier editions were aimed at programmers coming from C, the third edition changes this and targets programmers coming from languages like Java. It presents ~50 easy-to-remember rules of thumb along with their rationale in a very accessible (and enjoyable) style. For C++11 and C++14 the examples and a few issues are outdated and Effective Modern C++ should be preferred. [Review]
  - **Effective Modern C++ (Scott Meyers)** –This is basically the new version of Effective C++, aimed at C++ programmers making the transition from C++03 to C++11 and C++14.
  - **Effective STL (Scott Meyers)** –This aims to do the same to the part of the standard library coming from the STL what Effective C++ did to the language as a whole: It presents rules of thumb along with their rationale.
